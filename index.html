            <li>Studio Ghibli is known for the high quality of its filmmaking and its artistry. Its feature films won both critical and popular praise and influenced other animation studios.</li>
            <li>The name "Ghibli" was chosen by Miyazaki from the Italian noun ghibli, based on the Libyan Arabic name for <strong>hot desert wind</strong>, the idea being the studio would<em>"blow a new wind through the anime industry"</em>.</li>
            <li>The headquarters are in <strong>Tokyo</strong>.</li>

            <li>Five of the studio's films are among the ten highest-grossing anime feature films made in Japan. <strong>Spirited Away</strong>  is second, grossing 31.68 billion yen in Japan and over US$380 million worldwide; and <strong>Princess Mononoke</strong>  is fourth, grossing 20.18 billion yen.</li>
            <li>In October 2001, the <strong>Ghibli Museum</strong> opened in Mitaka, Tokyo. It contains exhibits based on Studio Ghibli films and shows animations, including a number of short Studio Ghibli films not available elsewhere.

            <li>Studio Ghibli director Hayao Miyazaki designed the museum himself, using storyboards similar to the ones he creates for his films. The design was influenced by European architecture such as the hilltop village of Calcata in Italy. The museum features internal and external spiral staircases built from iron, interior bridges, and balconies stretching throughout the building's height.</li>
